# Gedit Themes
Two minimalistic themes for gedit designed to minimize clutter and increase readability. Only four primary color styles are used for syntax highlighting.

##### Light theme
![Light theme](light-theme.png "Light theme")

##### Dark theme
![Dark theme](dark-theme.png "Dark theme")

The four primary colors differentiate general text, comments, keywords, and constants. Additional colors are used to highlight text selection, errors, notes (TODO, FIXME), and search results.

## Getting Started
You can try out these themes by adding them to gedit.

1. Download the xml theme files.
2. Select gedit's `Edit | Preferences` menu to open the dialog box.
3. Switch to the `Font & Colors` tab in the dialog box.
4. Press the `+` under `Color Scheme` and pick one of the downloaded theme files. The selected theme becomes the theme used by `gedit`.
5. Repeat for the other theme.

## Gedit Support
We tested the themes with `gedit` 2.30 and 3.4.2 on Debian and Ubuntu.


Enjoy!
