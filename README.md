# Gedit Themes for Coding

Themes with no visual clutter for increased readability.

## Why Better Themes?
Gedit default themes use too many colors for syntax highlighting. creating visual clutter and negatively affecting readability.

The three minimalistic themes in this package are designed to only use four primary color styles  for syntax highlighting, eliminating clutter and benefiting readability.

##### Light theme

##### Dark theme

#### Lighter Theme
The lighter theme is similar to the light theme, but with lighter background and text. This makes it better for larger fonts.

The four primary colors differentiate general text, comments, keywords, and constants. Additional colors are used to highlight text selection, errors, notes (TODO, FIXME), and search results.

## Quick Installation
Try the themes by adding them to gedit.

1. Download the xml theme files.
2. Select gedit's `Edit | Preferences` menu to open the dialog box.
3. Switch to the `Font & Colors` tab in the dialog box.
4. Press the `+` under `Color Scheme` and pick one of the downloaded theme files. The selected theme becomes the theme used by `gedit`.
5. Repeat for the other themes.

Enjoy!
